# Minesweeper
## Intoduction
This was a group project that I made in my Java programming class at Jacksonville State University. The purpose of this program was to make a game that is similar to Microsoft's minesweeper game. This game has included features like a timer, flag counter, and a save option. Each game is unquie and ends when a bomb is pressed and is won when all the squares that are not bombs are discovered.
